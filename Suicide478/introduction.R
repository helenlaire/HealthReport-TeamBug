# purpose of the project 
purpose <- "Suicide, as a major, preventable mental health problem, has been the leading causes of death among a variety of 
age groups worldwide [1]. As the suicidal rate kept increasing for the past years, under the social concerns and curiosity, 
many researchers have looked into the topic of suicide and have identified a wide range of risk factors, such as mental disorder,
substance abuse, and family histories [2]. However, their findings consist huge limitations - since the researchers could not 
study suicide under experimental control due to ethical reasons, they have little to no direct knowledge about how these risk 
factors exactly contribute and lead to suicide [3]. Moreover, despite the high incidence, the topic of suicide has not been 
adequately addressed enough both in terms of national awareness and strategy for intervention [1]. In other say, there is still 
a gap between the general public’s knowledge and prevention strategies that could and should be implemented. Therefore, by using 
the data from studies in the US, we would like to bridge the gap between the topic of suicide and the general public by not only 
making them aware of the common risk factors but also providing them prevention strategies through effective interactive 
visualizations. In addition, we will also compare national-level data to explore how some external factors, such as GDP, 
instead of internal factors, may associate or contribute to the suicidal rate."


info <-"There are many pieces of psychology research that have studied the area, and here are three recent researches. 
First of all, in 2018, Franklin and his fellow researchers attempt to study the suicide causes by creating suicide scenarios in 
virtual reality [3]. Participants are given choice based instructions in the laboratory and are exposed to multiple causes of 
suicide. Through observing factors’ effects on VR suicide rates, the researchers are able to tentatively investigate the cause 
of suicide, which re suicidal desire, agitation, and prior suicidality as the common factors. Their work brought up a new 
approach for assessing risk factors and prevention strategies of suicide. Second, the World Health Organization develops an 
action plan in 2013-2020, providing an overview of the topic aiming to increase public awareness of suicide prevention methods 
[4]. In 2014, Matsubayashi and her fellow researchers studied the effect of public awareness campaigns on suicide. By comparing 
suicide counts before and after a city-wide campaign in Japan, they found public awareness of depression promote care-seeking 
behaviors and was negatively correlate with the suicide rate. Although the underlying mechanism remains unclear, it is clear 
that the campaign reduces the suicide rate. Their researches brought up the importance of stimulating public awareness, as more 
frequent distributions associate with decrease number of suicide [5]. Third, Colucci and Lester, in 2013, studied the external 
systems’ impacts on suicide, especially for culture. They point out that 90% of people in US commit suicide due to mental 
disorder with a majority of elderly men, versus in China, young women has a higher rate of suicide. In Japan, suicide could 
mean an act of honor under certain circumstances, while Muslims see suicide an unforgivable act [6]. Therefore, seeing the 
great demographic differences among cultures, it is important to researchers to see the role of cultural context and use it 
a part of guiding work on understanding suicide. Based on the previous work and combining data from studies, our group wishes 
to bring a universal view to the general public on how to avoid risks behaviors and appropriately engage in prevention strategies."

data_one <- "

We are planning on using multiple datasets to study suicide-related mental health issues. The first data includes information about 
suicide rate in all states in the United States, and how the rate differs between female and male from 2000 to 2010. The data was accessed from Center 
for Disease Control and Prevention. From this data, we want to study the overall trend of suicide in the United States.
