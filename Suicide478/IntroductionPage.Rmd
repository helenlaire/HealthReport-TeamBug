Suicide, as a major, preventable mental health problem, has been the leading causes of death among a variety of 
age groups worldwide [1]. As the suicidal rate kept increasing for the past years, under the social concerns and curiosity, 
many researchers have looked into the topic of suicide and have identified a wide range of risk factors, such as mental disorder,
substance abuse, and family histories [2]. However, their findings consist huge limitations - since the researchers could not 
study suicide under experimental control due to ethical reasons, they have little to no direct knowledge about how these risk 
factors exactly contribute and lead to suicide [3]. Moreover, despite the high incidence, the topic of suicide has not been 
adequately addressed enough both in terms of national awareness and strategy for intervention [1]. In other say, there is still 
a gap between the general publicâ€™s knowledge and prevention strategies that could and should be implemented. Therefore, by using 
the data from both the US and worldwide, we would like to bridge the gap between the topic of suicide and the general public by not only 
making them aware of the common risk factors but also providing them prevention strategies through effective interactive 
visualizations. In addition, we will also compare national-level data to explore how some external factors, such as GDP, 
instead of internal factors, may associate or contribute to the suicidal rate.

This guide will be useful for anyone who would like to have a better understanding of the issues around suicide, anyone who might be struggling in mental health problem and potential suicide intention, and anyone who care about mental health of people around them. The best solution to avoid the suicide case is to know what causes it and what we can do to prevent it from happening. We want to use our analysis and report to help those people to know suicide is not an unstoppable decision and you are not only one fighting with it. In conclusion, our target audience is people who are struggling with suicide problem and people around them.

Tab functions: 
Our guide will present an organize visualization of data that helps answer the following questions: 

1) How would a person fit into a county by their adjusted gross income? </br>
2) What are the housing affordability compared across all counties by different years? </br>
3) What is the rate of economic progression over the years by counties based on poverty rate? </br>
4) Does the $15 minimum wage positively affect poverty rate?
