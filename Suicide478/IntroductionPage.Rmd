Suicide, as a major, preventable mental health problem, has been the leading causes of death among a variety of 
age groups worldwide [1]. As the suicidal rate kept increasing for the past years, under the social concerns and curiosity, 
many researchers have looked into the topic of suicide and have identified a wide range of risk factors, such as mental disorder,
substance abuse, and family histories [2]. However, their findings consist huge limitations - since the researchers could not 
study suicide under experimental control due to ethical reasons, they have little to no direct knowledge about how these risk 
factors exactly contribute and lead to suicide [3]. Moreover, despite the high incidence, the topic of suicide has not been 
adequately addressed enough both in terms of national awareness and strategy for intervention [1]. In other say, there is still 
a gap between the general public’s knowledge and prevention strategies that could and should be implemented. Therefore, by using 
the data from both the US and worldwide, we would like to bridge the gap between the topic of suicide and the general public by not only 
making them aware of the common risk factors but also providing them prevention strategies through effective interactive 
visualizations. In addition, we will also compare national-level data to explore how some external factors, such as GDP, 
instead of internal factors, may associate or contribute to the suicidal rate.

This guide will be useful for anyone who would like to have a better understanding of the issues around suicide, anyone who might be struggling in mental health problem and potential suicide intention, and anyone who care about mental health of people around them. The best solution to avoid the suicide case is to know what causes it and what we can do to prevent it from happening. We want to use our analysis and report to help those people to know suicide is not an unstoppable decision and you are not only one fighting with it. In conclusion, our target audience is people who are struggling with suicide problem and people around them.

Tab functions: 
Our guide will present an organize visualization of data that helps answer the following questions: 

1) How does suicide differ in gender? How does suicide differ across counties in US?</br>
2) What is the trend for suicide worldwide? What is it's associations with other external factors?</br>
3) What are the risk factors for depression? </br>
4) What are the protective factors for mental health?

### <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">Background Research</span>
There are many pieces of psychology research that have studied the area, and here are three recent researches. 
First of all, in 2018, Franklin and his fellow researchers attempt to study the suicide causes by creating suicide scenarios in 
virtual reality [3]. Participants are given choice based instructions in the laboratory and are exposed to multiple causes of 
suicide. Through observing factors’ effects on VR suicide rates, the researchers are able to tentatively investigate the cause 
of suicide, which re suicidal desire, agitation, and prior suicidality as the common factors. Their work brought up a new 
approach for assessing risk factors and prevention strategies of suicide. Second, the World Health Organization develops an 
action plan in 2013-2020, providing an overview of the topic aiming to increase public awareness of suicide prevention methods 
[4]. In 2014, Matsubayashi and her fellow researchers studied the effect of public awareness campaigns on suicide. By comparing 
suicide counts before and after a city-wide campaign in Japan, they found public awareness of depression promote care-seeking 
behaviors and was negatively correlate with the suicide rate. Although the underlying mechanism remains unclear, it is clear 
that the campaign reduces the suicide rate. Their researches brought up the importance of stimulating public awareness, as more 
frequent distributions associate with decrease number of suicide [5]. Third, Colucci and Lester, in 2013, studied the external 
systems’ impacts on suicide, especially for culture. They point out that 90% of people in US commit suicide due to mental 
disorder with a majority of elderly men, versus in China, young women has a higher rate of suicide. In Japan, suicide could 
mean an act of honor under certain circumstances, while Muslims see suicide an unforgivable act [6]. Therefore, seeing the 
great demographic differences among cultures, it is important to researchers to see the role of cultural context and use it 
a part of guiding work on understanding suicide. Based on the previous work and combining data from studies, our group wishes 
to bring a universal view to the general public on how to avoid risks behaviors and appropriately engage in prevention strategies.

1) Overall Trend: The first tab includes information about suicide rate in all states in the United States, and how the rate differs between female and male from 2000 to 2010. The data was accessed from Center for Disease Control and Prevention. From this data, we want to study the overall trend of suicide in the United States.

2) Worldwide Statistics


3) Risk Factors of Depression

4) Protective Factors of Mental Health: The fourth
